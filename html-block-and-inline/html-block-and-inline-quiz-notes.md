## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
  A block-level element always starts on a new line. In horizontal writing modes it occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container) and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block".
- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
  In inline layout, a mixed stream of text, replaced elements, and other inline boxes are laid out by fragmenting them into a stack of line boxes. Whithin each line box, inline-level boxes are aligned to each other vertically or horizontally, depending on the writing mode. Typically, they are aligned by the baselines of their text.
- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?
  The default height is the height of the content and the default width is the length of the page.
- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
  Inline elements have no default height or width. It is the height and width of the content.
