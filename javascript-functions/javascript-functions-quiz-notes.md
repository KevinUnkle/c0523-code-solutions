## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function in JavaScript is a reusable set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, that takes an input and returns an output.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function keyword, an optional name, a comma separated list of zero or more parameters surrounded by parenthesis, the start of the functions code block indicated with an opening curly brace, an optional return statement, the end of the functions code block indicated with a closing curly brace.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The functions name, a comma separated list of zero or more arguments surrounded by parenthesis.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A call function doesn't have a return statement or variables, or a console log.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is similar to a placeholder that is basically a variable whose value is not known until we call the function and pass an argument. When we define a function, we declare parameters. When we call a function, we pass it arguments.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  It is essentially a placeholder of data that can be called later.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  It causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program. It prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
