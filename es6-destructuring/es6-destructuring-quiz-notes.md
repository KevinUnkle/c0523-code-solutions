## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  A convenient way of extracting multiple values from data stored in objects and arrays.
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  let { property1: variable1, property2: variable2 } = object;
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  let x = scores [0], it then becomes let [x, y, z] = getScores()
  y = scores[1],
  z = scores[2]
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  Object destructuring uses named keys to extract values, Array destructuring uses positions within an array to achieve the same thing.
