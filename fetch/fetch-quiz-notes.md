## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does `fetch()` return?
  A promise that resolves to the Response to that request.
- What is the default request method used by `fetch()`?
  GET.
- How do you specify the request method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) when calling `fetch`?
  You add another parameter which is a object with properties.
- How does `fetch` report errors?
  A fetch() promise will reject with a TypeError when a network error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server-side, although this usually means permission issues or similar â€” a 404 does not constitute a network error, for example. An accurate check for a successful fetch() would include checking that the promise resolved, then checking that the Response.ok property has a value of true.
